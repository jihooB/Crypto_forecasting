This project investigates the financial behavior and predictability of two categories of digital assets: Clean and Dirty Cryptocurrencies. 
"Clean" cryptos are identified by their energy-efficient consensus algorithms (like Proof of Stake), while "Dirty" cryptos (such as Bitcoin) require significant energy consumption for mining and transactions.


The study is divided into two primary analytical phases:
1) Statistical Analysis:
   A comparison of log returns using metrics such as Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness, and Excess Kurtosis.
   The research suggests that "dirty" cryptos tend to offer more stable returns with fewer extreme tail risks compared to "clean" cryptos.


2) Forecasting Model Evaluation:
   The performance of various econometric and time-series models—including AR(1), MA(1), ARIMA(1,0,1), Naïve, Historical Mean, and Simple Moving Averages (SMA)—is tested using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


[Key FindingsPredictability] 
  The Simple Moving Average ($m=180$) was identified as the outperforming model for both asset types, as it effectively smoothens the high volatility and "noise" characteristic of the crypto market.
  Investment Recommendation: The project concludes that "dirty" cryptos, including established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are currently more suitable for stable investment due to more reliable forecasting and less extreme outlier behavior.
